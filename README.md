CliqToProject – Zoho Cliqtrix Contest Submission
📌 Overview

CliqToProject is an intelligent Zoho Cliq bot integrated with Zoho Projects to provide real-time project monitoring, task status checks, and automated alerts.
The bot eliminates the need to manually track multiple dashboards by bringing all task insights directly into Zoho Cliq.

This project was built end-to-end by overcoming several integration and deployment challenges across Zoho Projects API, Zoho Cliq Bot APIs, and Zoho Catalyst AppSail.
